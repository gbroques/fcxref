Introduction
------------

"External references" are also known as external links or cross-document references.

Manages **F**\ ree\ **C**\ AD e\ **x**\ ternal **ref**\ erences.

The following operations are supported:

1. *Finding* external references
2. *Renaming* external references
3. and *Removing* external references (**not yet implemented**)

Motivation
----------

On `Expressions: Known issues / remaining tasks <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Expressions#Known_issues_.2F_remaining_tasks>`_, it's mentioned:

    There is no expression manager implemented where all expressions in a document are listed, and can be created, deleted, queried, etc.

Large complex FreeCAD projects typically rely on extensive use of cross-document referencing to properties such as aliases in spreadsheets.

When you have dozens of references to the same property, it becomes very difficult to find all the places where references exist or rename the property.

``fcxref`` aims to fill this gap until similiar functionality can be added to FreeCAD core.

See the following related FreeCAD forum discussions for additional motivation:

* `Expression engine - Automatic renaming <https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=18049>`_
* `Rename a file containing external links <https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=471267>`_

Approach
--------
``fcxref`` relies on parsing the ``Document.xml`` in compressed ``.FCStd`` files.

Installation
------------

Available on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_.

.. code-block::

   pip install fcxref

Usage
-----
There are two ways to use ``fcxref``:

1. via the Python API
2. vai the Command Line

The following 2 sections cover these 2 usage methods with the below example.

Consider you have ``Example.FCStd`` that contains two references to ``Master#Spreadsheet.Value``:

1. in B1 of the ``Spreadsheet``
2. and in the expression of ``Cylinder.Radius``.

Python API
----------

find
^^^^

Simple Queries
""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: python

   from fcxref import find, Property
   
   base_path = './base/path/to/freecad/documents'
   references = find(base_path, Property('Master', 'Spreadsheet', 'Value'))
   print(references)

.. code-block::

   [Example.FCStd Spreadsheet.B1 (cells), Example.FCStd Cylinder.Radius (ExpressionEngine)]

Regular Expressions
"""""""""""""""""""

You can pass in regular expressions for document, object, or property names for more powerful expressions.

For example, query all external references to the ``Spreadsheet`` object in ``Master``:

.. code-block:: python

   from fcxref import find, Property
      
   base_path = './base/path/to/freecad/documents'
   references = find(base_path, Property('Master', 'Spreadsheet', '.*'))

rename
^^^^^^

The ``rename`` function takes:

1. the base path to look for FreeCAD documents in
2. the name or label of the document
3. the name or label of the object
4. and a 2-element tuple containing the property before and after renaming. 

It returns a dictionary where keys are filepaths to updated ``.FCStd`` files,
and values are XML `Element`_ objects representing updated ``Document.xml`` files.

.. _Element: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element

.. code-block:: python

   from fcxref import rename
   
   base_path = './base/path/to/freecad/documents'
   root_by_document_path = find(base_path, 'Master', 'Spreadsheet', ('Value', 'RenamedValue'))
   print(root_by_document_path)

.. code-block::

   {'Example.FCStd': <Element 'Document' at 0x7efcd281cc20>, 'Master.FCStd': <Element 'Document' at 0x7f4d13c39270>}

Command Line
------------
Upon installing ``fcxref``, the ``fcxref`` command will become globally accessible.

For usage information, pass ``--help`` to each command.

Each command scans for ``*.FCStd`` files recursively from the current working directory.

Thus, you should navigate to a directory where you store your FreeCAD documents before executing ``fcxref`` commands.

.. code-block::

   $ fcxref --help â†µ
   usage: fcxref [-h] [--version] {find,rename} ...
   
   Manage cross-document references to properties.
   
   optional arguments:
     -h, --help     show this help message and exit
     --version      show program's version number and exit
   
   Commands:
     {find,rename}
       find         Find cross-document references to a property
       rename       Rename cross-document references to a property

find
^^^^

.. code-block::

   $ fcxref find --help â†µ                
   usage: fcxlink find <document> <object> <property>
   
   Surround arguments containing special characters in quotes (e.g. "<<My Label>>").
   
   positional arguments:
     document    Document name or label.
     object      Object name or label.
     property    Property.
   
   optional arguments:
     -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Simple Queries
""""""""""""""

.. code-block::
   
   $ fcxref find Master Spreadsheet Value â†µ
   2 references to Master#Spreadsheet.Value found:
     Example.FCStd Spreadsheet.B1 (cells)
     Example.FCStd Cylinder.Radius (ExpressionEngine)

Regular Expressions
"""""""""""""""""""

Regular expressions for more powerful queries are also supported:

.. code-block::

   $ fcxref find Master Spreadsheet ".*" â†µ
   3 references to Master#Spreadsheet..* found:
   Example.FCStd Spreadsheet.B1 (cells) -> Master#Spreadsheet.Value
   Example.FCStd Cylinder.Radius (ExpressionEngine) -> Master#Spreadsheet.Value
   AnotherExample.FCStd Spreadsheet.A1 (cells) -> Master#Spreadsheet.AnotherValue

ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** When using special characters on the command line such as ``.``, or ``<`` and ``>`` for label names, surround the argument in double-quotes.

rename
^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   $ fcxref rename --help â†µ
   usage: fcxlink rename <document> <object> <from_property> <to_property>
   
   Surround arguments containing special characters in quotes (e.g. "<<My Label>>").
   
   positional arguments:
     document       Document name or label of reference to rename.
     object         Object name or label of reference to rename.
     from_property  Property of reference before renaming.
     to_property    Property of reference after renaming.
   
   optional arguments:
     -h, --help     show this help message and exit


Simple Renames
""""""""""""""

The ``rename`` command will prompt users for confirmation before modifying any files,
and defaults to "No" if an explicit "Yes" is not provided.

.. code-block::

   $ fcxref rename Master Spreadsheet Value RenamedValue â†µ
   The following 2 document(s) reference Master#Spreadsheet.Value:
     Example.FCStd
     Master.FCStd
   
   Do you wish to rename the references to Master#Spreadsheet.RenamedValue? [y/N] 
   y â†µ
   2 documents updated.
